### Configuration of HAProxy and Load-Balancer using Ansible

HAProxy is free, open source software that provides a high availability load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications that spreads requests across multiple servers and Ansible is an automation tool used for configuration management.

FRONTEND SERVER --> Reverse proxy + client

BACKEND SERVER --> all the webservers

This ansible playbook is dynamic, which means you just need to add the web-server IPs in the inventory file and ansible will automatically configure everything.
